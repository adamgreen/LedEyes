My mbed based reimagining of Michal Janyst's Arduino Pumpkin Eyes project. It plays the same eye animations as Michal's
original version but has a few modifications to the source code:
* Ported to run on the [[https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/ | mbed LPC1768]].
* Ported to use the [[https://www.adafruit.com/products/1854 | Holek HT16K33 based 8x8 LED matrices from Adafruit]]
  instead of the MAX7219 based LED matrices in the original.
* Added an [[https://www.adafruit.com/products/1463 | Adafruit NeoPixel Ring]] and used it to simulate a flickering
  candle within the pumpkin.
* Made the various eye animations into C++ classes, sharing a common interface.
* The eye animations now run as state machines so that they can easily run concurrently with the Neopixel candle
  animation which was already state machine based.
* Many of the eye animations now take advantage of a more generic keyframe based pupil animation class to reduce code
  redundancy.

I also diverged from the original design by making round eye holes in the pumpkin and placing the square LED matrices
behind these holes to hide the unused pixels in the corner of the matrices.

==Electronics

The electronic components were soldered to a basic prototyping board. Even the
[[https://www.adafruit.com/products/1463 | Adafruit NeoPixel Ring]] was soldered directly to the board, above the other
electronics so that nothing obstructed its illumination of the pumpkin. It has 3 male headers for connection to external
components:
* 1 x 2-pin header for connection to a DC barrel jack that was hot glued into the back of the pumpkin.
* 2 x 4-pin headers for connection to the two
  [[https://www.adafruit.com/products/1854 | I2C based Adafruit 8x8 LED matrices]]. The 4 wire cable connecting these
  matrices to the main PCB have the following mapping:
|= Wire Colour |= Signal Name |= mbed Pin |
| Blue         | SCL          | p10       |
| Green        | SDA          | p9        |
| Yellow       | Ground       | Gnd       |
| Orange       | 5V           | Vin       |

Both of the 8x8 LED matrices are connected to the same I2C bus but have different addresses. The left eye uses a matrix
which has been set to the default address of 0x70. The right eye uses a matrix which has been modified to use an address
of 0x71. The was done by shorting the A0 pads on the controller as documented
[[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/changing-i2c-address | here.]]
